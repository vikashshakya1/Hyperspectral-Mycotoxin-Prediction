# Hyperspectral Mycotoxin Prediction  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on processing hyperspectral imaging data, performing dimensionality reduction, and training machine learning models to predict **mycotoxin levels (DON concentration)** in corn samples.

```

## 🛠 Installation & Setup  
### 1️⃣ Clone the repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Hyperspectral-Mycotoxin-Prediction.git
cd Hyperspectral-Mycotoxin-Prediction
```

### 2️⃣ Create a virtual environment (Optional but recommended)  
```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Mac/Linux
env\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
```

### 3️⃣ Install dependencies  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📊 Dataset  
The dataset contains spectral reflectance data of corn samples with multiple wavelength bands.  
- **Features**: Spectral reflectance values across various bands.  
- **Target Variable**: DON concentration (continuous value for regression).  

## 🔍 Tasks & Methodology  
### **1. Data Exploration & Preprocessing**  
✅ Load and inspect the dataset for missing values & outliers.  
✅ Normalize spectral reflectance data.  
✅ Visualize spectral bands (line plots, heatmaps).  

### **2. Dimensionality Reduction**  
✅ Apply **PCA** (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce dimensions.  
✅ Explore variance explained by principal components.  
✅ Visualize reduced data (2D/3D scatter plots).  

### **3. Model Training**  
✅ Implement **Random Forest, XGBoost, or a Neural Network**.  
✅ Split data into **80% training, 20% testing**.  
✅ Perform hyperparameter tuning (Grid Search / Random Search).  

### **4. Model Evaluation**  
✅ Evaluate using **MAE, RMSE, R² Score**.  
✅ Visualize results with **scatter plots of actual vs. predicted values**.  

## 🚀 How to Run  
Run the training script:  
```bash
python train.py
```

Run inference on new data:  
```bash
python inference.py --input sample_data.csv
```

(Optional) Run the Streamlit app (if implemented):  
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 📑 Results & Insights  
📌 PCA reduced the feature dimensions while retaining most of the variance.  
📌 Model performance was evaluated using multiple regression metrics.  
📌 Possible improvements include **transformers, attention mechanisms, or ensemble learning**.  

## 🎯 Future Work  
✔ Implement transformers for spectral feature extraction.  
✔ Build a **Streamlit-based interactive app** for predictions.  
✔ Experiment with **GNNs, CNNs, and LSTMs** for hyperspectral data processing.  

## 📩 Submission Details
